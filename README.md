This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This project was started to help me build a foundation with frameworks such as Next.js and Sanity.io. The first portfolio I built was only made in HTML and javascript, with a CSS library called tailwindCSS. I wanted to expand my knowledge and get into component driven development.

This project still uses TailwindCSS as a CSS framework, but with the inclusion of Next.js I can make use of API endpoints to call data dynamically from different sources. Thats where Sanity comes from. It is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to update different content on the webpage without changing any hardcoded items.

A huge inspiration came from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgi2iz9P6U&list=WL&index=15&t=7462s) where I followed along to learn various aspects of the full-stack development. I've taken a lot of the tips I've learned and spun it into something more I can do myself.
